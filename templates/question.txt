24 Points is a classic mathematical game that requires the result of operations on four numbers to equal 24.  
Given a deck of playing cards, the objective is to use the numbers on four cards and the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to ultimately achieve the result of 24.

Rules:  
1. Each card must be used exactly once.  
2. The four operations of addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷) are allowed.  
3. Parentheses () can be used to change the order of operations.  
4. No other operation symbols or numbers are allowed.  
5. Division results can be decimals or infinite non-terminating decimals.

Example: For the four cards 3, 3, 8, 8, the expression (8 ÷ 3 × (3 - 8 ÷ 3)) = 24 can be used to reach the answer.

Below are four randomly drawn cards from a deck of playing cards. Please determine whether it is possible to obtain 24 through operations.  
If possible, provide one way to achieve it(NOTE: There should be no other characters. Only equation is allowed. You should only answer "EQUATION", where EQUATION can be like "(8 ÷ 3 × (3 - 8 ÷ 3)) = 24"); otherwise, output "NO."
